## MicroHack introduction

### What is Business Continuity?

When you design for resiliency, you must understand your availability requirements.
- How much downtime is acceptable? 
- How much will potential downtime cost your business?
- How much should you invest in making the application highly available?
- You also must define what it means for the application to be available.

üí° For instance, would you consider the application to be ‚Äòunavailable‚Äô if it allows you to place an order, but fails to process it within the usual time period? Also, it‚Äôs crucial to evaluate the likelihood of a system failure. Is implementing a countermeasure strategy financially justifiable? Remember, effective resilience planning is rooted in the business‚Äôs needs. Here are some strategies to guide your thinking when planning for system resiliency.

The following picture describes in detail the individual levels / disaster recovery tier levels and also provides an overview of which topics we should deal with when talking about disaster recovery. The individual terms, terminologies and categories will be discussed in this microhack which will also provide one approach and a few tips on how to define them in your own company.

## Understand the Disaster Recovery (DR) terms and define a DR strategy

# Contoso Ltd - Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) Strategy

## Background
Contoso Ltd is a global company that relies on advanced technology to manage its operations efficiently. Their business applications, all hosted in the Azure cloud, are crucial to their daily functions and overall success. These applications power a wide range of essential business processes:
- **App 1:** Fabric Robot Automation
- **App 2:** Customer Help Desk Services
- **App 3:** Archive Service

Leaders at Contoso Ltd understand that any downtime can result in significant financial losses and operational disruptions. Therefore, the company has mandated a thorough review of its Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) strategies to strike a balance between business continuity, customer satisfaction, and operational costs. The goal is to design and implement recovery plans that can swiftly restore services and minimize downtime in the event of unforeseen disasters.

## Scenario Overview
A natural disaster struck the region hosting Contoso applications on Azure one Friday evening, causing outages in many services and leading to a cascading failure of all Contoso applications. The sudden disruption impacted essential business functions, leaving the company to grapple with significant financial losses and operational chaos. Customers and stakeholders were left in a state of uncertainty as they awaited updates on service restoration. The IT team faced immense pressure to rapidly deploy recovery strategies to minimize downtime, restore critical operations, and ensure that such an incident would not recur in the future.

Participants must design and implement recovery strategies to meet business targets while considering costs for high availability.

## Application Overview
| Application | Business Function | Criticality | SLA | RTO | RPO | Downtime Cost |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| App1        | TBD               | Critical    | 99.995% | 1 hour | 10 minutes | $50,000/hour |
| App2        | TBD               | High        | 99.95%  | 2 hours | 15 minutes | $25,000/hour |
| App3        | TBD               | Medium      | 99.9%   | 6 hours | 4 hours    | $10,000/hour |

## Recovery Costs for High Availability
| Application | Cost of RTO Compliance | Cost of RPO Compliance | Cost of SLA Compliance | Fully Highly Available Cost |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| App1        | $100,000               | $50,000                | $75,000                | $200,000                    |
| App2        | $75,000                | $35,000                | $50,000                | $125,000                    |
| App3        | $50,000                | $20,000                | $25,000                | $75,000                     |

## Challenge Objective
### Actions
Participants must:
1. Prioritize recovery of applications based on their criticality and business impact.
2. Decide which parts of the system to make highly available (HA) based on financial constraints.
3. Calculate the trade-offs between downtime costs and HA investments.

### Success criteria

* Understood the different terms from BCDR.
* Thought about the last successful disaster recovery of daily used applications.
* Identified the responsibilities and roles within your current company in respect to BCDR.
* Defined four levels of disaster recovery categories, including availability SLA.
