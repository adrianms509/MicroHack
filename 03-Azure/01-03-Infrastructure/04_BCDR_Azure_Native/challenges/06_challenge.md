## Challenge 6 - Protect your Azure PaaS (Azure SQL Database) with Disaster recovery

### Goal ðŸŽ¯

In challenge 6, you will focus on implementing disaster recovery strategies for Azure SQL databases using Failover Groups. The primary objective is to ensure business continuity by protecting critical data stored in Azure SQL databases.

### Actions
* Implement Failover Groups for Azure SQL Database:
  * Task 1: Create a Failover Group between two Azure SQL databases located in different Azure regions (Germany West central and Sweden Central).
  * Task 2: Configure automatic failover policies and test the failover mechanism to ensure seamless transition in case of a disaster.

### Success Criteria âœ…
* You have successfully created and configured a Failover Group for Azure SQL Database, ensuring data is replicated and accessible across regions.
* You have conducted failover tests for the Azure SQL Database, demonstrating the effectiveness of your disaster recovery strategy.
* You were able to connect to the failed-over SQL DB from the failed-over VM.
