## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 1](../../Readme.md#challenge-1) before continuing with this challenge.

In this challenge, you will successfully onboard your Linux Virtual Machine to a centralized Recovery Services Vault and leverage Azure Backup Center to Protect with Backup in Azure. 

* Task 1: Enable Azure Backup for Linux VM.
* Task 2: Enable Azure Backup for Blobs
* Task 3: Restore a VM in Azure.

If you have not created the Linux Machine Successfully follow this guide to create it on the portal

To backup our storage account, we should assign the Backup Vault in Primary Region some access permissions.

### Enable system managed Identity for the backup vault and clipboard the MI object ID
Go to the Backup Vault in the Primary Region (Germany West Central) and navigate to the Identity Tab

![Identity Tab](./img/060.png)

Click **Azure role assignments**

![Enable system managed Identity](./img/060a.png)

### Assign the "Storage Backup Contributor" role to Backup vault managed identity
Go back to the Storage Account the Primary Region (Germany West Central). Navigate to **Access Control (IAM)** Tab and add a role assignment.
