## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 3](../../Readme.md#challenge-3) before continuing with this challenge.

In challenge 4, you will focus on implementing disaster recovery strategies for Azure storage accounts using replication. The primary objective is to ensure business continuity by protecting critical data stored in Azure storage accounts against potential disasters.

### Actions
* Disaster Recovery for Azure Storage Account:
  * Task 1: Set up and configure Azure Storage Account replication to another region using Geo-redundant storage (GRS) or Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) to ensure data availability in case of regional outages.
  * Task 2: Perform a failover test for the storage account to validate the disaster recovery setup.

## Disaster Recovery for Azure Storage Account

## Task 1: Set up and configure Azure Storage Account replication to another region using Geo-redundant storage (GRS) or Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) to ensure data availability in case of regional outages.

Navigate to the **Azure Storage Account** in the Germany West Central Region. Open the tab **Redundancy**:

### Choose Geo-redundant storage (GRS) as redundancy option. This will enable cross-replication of your storage account with the paired region Germany North.

### You can see now Germany North as the Secondary Region of the Storage Account:

## Task 2: Perform a failover test for the storage account to validate the disaster recovery setup.

### Run the test failover from Germany West Central to the Sweden Central Region
