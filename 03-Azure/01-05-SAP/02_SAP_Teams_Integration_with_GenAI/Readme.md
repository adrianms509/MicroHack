# **MicroHack SAP & Teams Integration with Copilot Studio and Generative AI**

## **MicroHack Introduction**
This Microhack scenario walks through the use of AI to optimize SAP workflows within Microsoft Teams. This solution is particularly advantageous for mobile users or those with limited SAP experience, enabling them to efficiently manage even complex, repetitive SAP tasks.

**Example: Product Specification Updates**
* **Scenario:** Product Managers at Contoso need to review and update product information in their SAP system on a regular basis.
* **Solution:** With the SAP and Teams integration provided by Copilot Studio, the product manager at Contoso can easily get the current product information from SAP and update specifications conveniently in an adaptive card.  

By integrating SAP with Microsoft Teams using Copilot Studio and Generative AI, you can significantly enhance productivity and streamline workflows. This blog will take you through the entire process of setting up a Copilot to interact with SAP data in Teams. We'll utilize the Power Platform and SAP OData Connector to achieve this integration. By following along you will create and configure a Copilot, test and deploy it within Teams, enable Generative AI, build automation flows, and create adaptive cards for dynamic data representation and even change data in SAP. 

This MicroHack is based on the Blog Post [SAP & Teams Integration with Copilot Studio and Generative AI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/sapapplications/sap--teams-integration-with-copilot-studio-and-generative-ai/4213260), which you can check for further resources.

## **MicroHack Context**
The solution consists of three main components: Copilot Studio, Power Automate Flow and SAP OData Connector.
* Copilot Studio: is a web-based tool that allows you to create and manage conversational AI agents, called Copilots, that can interact with users through Microsoft Teams.
* Power Automate Flow: is a tool that allows you to automate workflows between your applications.
* SAP OData Connector: is a custom connector that enables you to connect to SAP systems using the OData protocol.
The following diagram illustrates how these components work together to provide a seamless SAP and Teams integration experience.

## **Objectives:**
After completing this MicroHack you will:
* Know how to build a custom Copilot.
* Understand the differences between actions and topics of Copilot.
* Know to connect Copilot with SAP OData system.
* Leverage Power Automate Flow and the SAP OData Connector to build a robust automated workflow. 
* Able to have a Copilot within Microsoft Teams.
* Able to access and update data in the SAP system from Microsoft Teams.

## **Challenges:**

### **Challenge 1 - Prerequisites and landing zone preparation**
#### Goal
